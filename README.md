## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [here](https://riqydev.github.io/clipboard-landing-page/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (SASS)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM


### What I learned

I learned quite a lot doing this challenge. It was a really fun challenge and I recommend others try it! I feel like I got a better understanding of working with a mobile first workflow, and I improved on my overall positioning of elements & html structure. I also tried out BEM (or my take on BEM rather) and it helped me quite a bit with how I structured things. I planned ahead more than I have with previous challenges and it paid off. If you're looking to give your layout skills a test, I highly recommend you try this challenge.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to try and keep using BEM and getting better with my html & css structure.
